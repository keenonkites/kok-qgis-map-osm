Repository with QGIS styles and documents how to create nice maps in QGIS out of OSM data.


Introduction
=============
QGIS is a great tool for creating nice maps. 


History of development
======================
After having started to play around with QGIS and NaturalEarth I wanted to have maps with local data where I can zoom in more. It was also clear that it has to be open data, so it was completely obvious to use OSM Data.
I started with the shape downloads of Geofabrik and using the styles from the 3liz/osm-in-qgis project on github (https://github.com/3liz/osm-in-qgis) and soon changed/extended the styles and added other layers to my map (contour, hillshading, missing lakes, ....)
